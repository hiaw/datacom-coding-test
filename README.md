   - Dropdown for product selection (4 items):
   ```
   const PRODUCTS = [
   { id: 1, name: &#39;Laptop&#39;, price: 999 },
   { id: 2, name: &#39;Phone&#39;, price: 699 },
   { id: 3, name: &#39;Headphones&#39;, price: 199 },
   { id: 4, name: &#39;Tablet&#39;, price: 499 },
   ];
   ```

   - &quot;Submit Order&quot; button
2. Orders List
   - Display all submitted orders with their id, clientâ€™s name and current status
     (Pending, Processing, Completed)
   - Automatically update the status without a page refresh

### Backend (Node.js)
